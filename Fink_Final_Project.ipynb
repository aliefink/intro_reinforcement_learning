        "### **Abstract** \n",
        "Computational models of mood seek to describe the impact of reward computations on human mood fluctuations. These models have repeatedly shown that one's mood state is altered by reward outcomes, reward prediction errors, and expected value of reward options in monetary gambling tasks. [3] Current mood models fail to account for counterfactual outcomes as a model-based reward signal that impacts mood. Counterfactuals are defined as the difference in reward obtained and reward that *could have* been obtained, had one made a different decision. In the present study, counterfactuals are calcuated as a policy-weighted reward difference. [1] I aim to investigate the relationship between counterfactual outcomes and mood responses. I hypothesize that mood rating will change as a function of the integrated advantage of counterfactual outcomes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Understanding human mood responses to external stimuli is a central goal of computational psychiatry. Mood disorders, like major depressive disorder, are debilitating and life-threatening. Without a clear understanding of the relationship between mood fluctuations and reward computations in humans, we cannot effectively treat patients with mood disorders. \n",
        "\n",
        "I hypothesize that model-based reward computations heaviliy impact mood. Current computational models of mood include only model-free reward computations, like reward prediction errors, to account for mood fluctuations during decision making. By not accounting for model-based reward signals in computational models, these computational theories about mood state are lacking. Such models have failed to find differences in encoding model-free reward computations in patients with major depressive disorder, showing that these models are missing a key component mood. Counterfactual signals are a model-based signal often thought of as regret. These signals are known to effect decision-making behavior and in patients with depression, regret is heightened and contributes to symptoms of rumination. I hypothesize that models using model-based counterfactual signals will out perform models with solely model-free reward computations. \n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than calculating counterfactual signals as the raw difference in outcome - possible outcome, I hypothesize that counterfactual signals are computed as a policy-weighted reward difference. The PWRD seeks to model mood as an Integrated Advantage [1], where mood is influenced by an agent's appraisal of their actions. Measuring counterfactual signals as a PWRD allows models to account for an agent's individual preference for loss, risk, and gamble choice. \n",
        "\n",
        "Subjects will play the Subjective Wellbeing task. The SWB is a 150 trial gambling task where participants are offered a safe bet reward option or a gamble reward option with a 50% chance of a greater or worse outcome than the safe bet option. The outcome of the unchosen option is shown to subjects after they make their choice, creating a counterfactual reward signal. Every 3 trials subjects rate their current happiness rating. \n",
        "\n",
        "I hypothesize that the policy-weighted reward difference model will best predict subject's mood ratings throughout the subjective-wellbeing task. \n",

        "\n",
        "Prior to calculating counterfactual outcomes, patient-specific gamble preferences must be estimated. Using a 3-parameter Prospect Theory Model, I estimated a patient's loss aversion, risk aversion, and gamble choice probability. First, the subjective utility for the safe and gamble choice was calculated for every trial, with different calculations for different trial types (mix,loss,gain). Then, the gamble choice probability was estimated using the difference in subjective utility of gamble and safe choices in a softmax function. Loss aversion, risk aversion, and gamble choice probability were estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.[2]\n",
